# ConnectionPool
This script simulates the difference between queryng database server using single instance VS using connection pool.

Notes:
1) Adjust your database connecton configurations inside createconnection and createPoolConnection functions
2) change the TRAFFIC_NUMBER constant value to the traffic you want to simulate
3) change the query to the one that fits you and run the script.
